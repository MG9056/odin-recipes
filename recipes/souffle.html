        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>100g Butter, chopped</li>
        <li>100g (1/2 cup) caster sugar</li>
        <li>50g (1/3 cup) plain flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Pinch of cream of tartar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>8 Lindt Lindor Dark Chocolate Balls</li> 
        <li>60ml (1/4 cup) thickened cream</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease four 310ml (1 1/4-cup) ovenproof dishes with butter.</li>
        <li>Melt chocolate and butter in a large glass or ceramic bowl in microwave on high, stirring every minute until smooth.
        Cool for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir the sugar, flour and egg yolks into the chocolate mixture until well combined.</li>
        <li>Use an electric beater to whisk egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl until soft peaks form.
        Add the extra sugar and whisk until firm peaks form. Use a large metal spoon to fold into the chocolate mixture
        until combined</li>
        <li>Divide the chocolate mixture among the greased dishes. Press 2 chocolate balls into the centre of the
        chocolate mixture in each dish. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until moist crumbs cling to a skewer
        inserted into the centre.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, to make the sauce, heat the chocolate, thickened cream and butter in a heatproof jug in microwave
        on high, stirring every minute until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Serve with sauce and double cream.</li>
    </ol>
